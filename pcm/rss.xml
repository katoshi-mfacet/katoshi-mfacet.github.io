      <description>Dis article dey talk about how one pesin use generative AI, specifically Gemini, to build a 30-language blog site. E explain di process of automatic article generation, categorization, tagging, and translation using Gemini&apos;s API.  E highlight how Gemini help with accessibility improvements wey di pesin no even know about before. Di author argue say generative AI don break down barriers like language and accessibility for information sharing, making am easier to create and maintain multilingual websites.  E conclude say generative AI no just help am build di website, but also expand e imagination and overcome maintenance challenges.  E suggest say dis technology go empower more pipo to share dia information online, despite cultural and other barriers wey still dey.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about how generative AI dey change software development.  E introduce &quot;Development-Driven Development&quot;, wey mean say make you dey always create useful tools during development, to make am faster and better.  E also talk about &quot;Refactoring-Driven Testing&quot;, wey mean say make you create tests only when you dey refactor your code, especially for parts wey no go likely change again.  Di article argue say dis two approaches dey important for di future of software development, especially as we dey move towards more user-experience focused and omnidirectional system development.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about how AI technology dey advance too fast, wey dey lead to &quot;time compression.&quot;  Because of dis speed, we no dey see all di risks wey dis new technology dey bring (&quot;social blind spots&quot;).  Di author dey argue say dis fast progress dey dangerous because e dey happen faster dan we fit understand am and solve di problems.  E dey suggest say to solve dis problem, we need to use AI itself to control how fast e dey develop, like a &quot;built-in stabilizer,&quot; to make sure say di benefits still pass di risks.  E dey call dis kind society wey pipo no dey see time di same way a &quot;Chronoscramble Society.&quot;</description>

      <description>Dis article dey yarn about how GitHub fit turn to more dan just a place for software; e fit be like one big library for all kinds of knowledge.  E talk about DeepWiki, one tool wey use AI to automatically create wiki pages for GitHub projects, showing how AI fit help organize information.  Di writer also talk about im own project, &quot;Intellectual Factory,&quot; wey use AI to turn blog posts into different formats (videos, translations, etc.).  E believe say GitHub fit become an &quot;Intellectual Mine,&quot; a central place where pipo go share documents and ideas, and AI go use dis to create even more knowledge.  E even talk about &quot;Intellectual Crystals,&quot; special ideas wey go spark new discoveries. In short, e dey see GitHub as one major part of a future where AI and human creativity go work togeda to build a massive, shared knowledge base.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about &quot;Idea Gestalt Collapse&quot;, wey be say wen we try to define ideas too much, dem go scatter.  E use example of chair, wey fit be anytin wey pesin fit sit on, no be just things wey dem make for sit down. To avoid dis, make we focus on how tins dey work, how dem relate, and di whole picture. E apply dis idea to consciousness for characters for stories and robots. E argue say whether a robot get consciousness depend on how we see am, and say many arguments against AI consciousness na just Idea Gestalt Collapse, because dem no use scientific, logical, or valid reasons.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about di gap between intuition and logic, especially for international relations. E say pipo often feel say world peace dey important, but dem quick dismiss am sake of national interest.  Di author argue say national interest na unpredictable concept wey pipo dey use to justify war, and e no dey good for long-term survival. Instead, e suggest say we suppose focus on permanent peace, good governance, and economic prosperity, wey fit lead to progressive accumulation of knowledge and technology. Dis approach, according to am, go be better dan national interest, wey e compare to Stockholm Syndrome.  Di author introduce di concept of &quot;intellectual crystals,&quot; wey be ways to explain intuitive ideas with logic, using mathematics as a model. E argue say by finding dis crystals, we fit build stronger arguments and improve our intellectual growth.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey explain how artificial intelligence, especially big language models, dey learn. E argue say learning get two sides: ‘metacognitive learning’ wey be like say you dey learn by doing am again and again, and ‘metaphysical learning’ wey be like say you just know am instantly afta you don see am or hear am once.  E introduce di idea of ‘frameworks’ wey be like di structure wey dey help us to arrange and understand information.  Natural language dey act as a special framework wey make am possible for metaphysical learning.  Di article talk say big language models dey use attention mechanisms to learn frameworks, and dis na wetin dem call ‘Natural Born Frameworker’.  E conclude say humans too be Natural Born Frameworkers and say natural language don evolve to be a very good framework for learning.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about &quot;Chronoscramble Society,&quot; wey be say pipo dey see time differently because of generative AI.  Before, time perception differences bin dey because of things like location, culture, and generation, but now, even pipo wey dey work for AI don dey see time differently. Dis na because of how fast AI dey develop and how e dey affect different areas.  Di article talk say dis differences no easy to solve because e dey hard to explain and e need deep understanding of tech, economy, and society.  E also talk about how different pipo get different predictions about di future, and how biases dey affect dis.  Di author use di game &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; as an example of how pipo with different perspectives fit still work togeda to achieve one goal, wey e suggest say we suppose cooperate even though we dey see time differently.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about how generative AI don change software development and simulation.  Di writer don build systems wey dey use generative AI to create different kinds of content (e call am Intellectual Factory). E also talk about &quot;Omnidirectional Engineering&quot;, where one pesin fit build a whole system alone with generative AI.  E introduce &quot;Liquidware&quot;, wey be software wey dey very flexible and easy to change.  E talk about &quot;Business Process-Oriented development&quot;, wey dey focus on individual processes instead of general optimization. Finally, e talk about how generative AI dey change simulation systems, making dem easier to create and use, and how dis go lead to a new way of thinking wey e call &quot;Simulation Thinking&quot;, where pipo go use simulations to solve problems and make decisions.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey tok about how software development dey change. Before now, dem dey focus on making sure say wetin dem write for specifications match wetin dem build. But now, dem dey focus more on user experience, how di software dey behave. Di author dey suggest a new approach: Experience &amp; Behavior Engineering. Dis approach no follow di old style of specification and implementation. E dey focus on improving how di user feel, even if e mean say dem go need to rebuild di whole software.  Di author also talk about Liquidware, wey be software wey dey very flexible and fit each user perfectly, thanks to AI.  E say as software development automation dey increase, Experience &amp; Behavior Engineering go be di new way.  Di article define behavior as states wey dey change over time and say testing behavior na to check how good di user experience be, plus making sure say di functions dey correct. Finally, di article conclude say di best user experience na like how we dey control our body—seamless and effortless—and dat na di ultimate goal of Liquidware.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey tok about &quot;nolej krystalizayshon&quot;, wey be like to take plenti informashon wey we don know and arrange am well well to form new ideas. E use di example of how plane dey fly, explainin say wings be di key tin wey make plane fly, and dem get different functions wey dey togeda.  E talk say dis way of arrangin nolej fit lead to new discoveries, even if di individual pieces of informashon no be new.  E create three levels: &quot;nolej leik&quot; (plenty informashon wey no dey arrange), &quot;nolej beis&quot; (informashon wey don dey arrange), and &quot;nolej jemboks&quot; (new ideas wey come from arrangin di informashon).  Di article argue say anybody fit do dis &quot;nolej krystalizayshon&quot;, and say e fit help us solve problems and reach places wey we no even tink we fit reach before.</description>

      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>Dis article dey explain Artificial Learning Intelligence System (ALIS), one system wey go combine innate learning (like wetin neural networks dey do) and acquired learning (wey dem go gather knowledge from outside di network). ALIS go use five parts: intelligent processor (wey dey reason and extract knowledge), knowledge store (wey dey save knowledge), di world (di environment), state memory (temporary memory), and framework (rules for choosing knowledge).  E go work by di processor acting on di world, extracting knowledge, and using am for future actions.  Di article emphasizes using natural language text for acquired knowledge, state memory, and frameworks because e easy to understand, share, and modify.  ALIS go start as a simple chat AI wey dey save chat history as knowledge, den gradually improve by adding pre-check and post-check comments to choose relevant knowledge better.  Di article also talk about using formal languages and models for knowledge representation and how ALIS go fit develop small small through agile methods, eventually becoming a powerful tool for many intellectual tasks and even embodied AI.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey explain natural language machine learning (NLML), one new kind machine learning wey dey use Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike normal machine learning wey dey use number data, NLML dey use language.  E dey use pre-trained LLMs and e learning dey happen for one knowledge base, no be inside di LLM parameters. Di article use example of General Affairs and Administrative Affairs departments to show how NLML fit learn how dem dey share work. E compare NLML with normal machine learning, showing say NLML dey learn faster, need less data, and no need much pre-processing because e dey use di LLM&apos;s existing knowledge and reasoning.  Even though LLMs dey slow to process language, NLML&apos;s efficiency go make am more important as normal machine learning reach e limit.</description>

      <description>Dis article na about how di writer build one system wey dey automatically create presentation videos from blog posts using generative AI.  E explain say e use SVG format for di presentation materials sake of say e easy to manipulate with text-based AI.  Di main challenge na to prevent and detect text overflow for di generated SVG.  E try different methods, including giving di AI strict rules, post-generation checks with anoda AI, and finally, writing a special program to accurately detect overflow.  After generating di slides, e use anoda AI to create a narration script, convert am to audio, and den combine everything to create a final video using ffmpeg.  E conclude say while similar services go likely emerge soon, building dis system teach am important lessons about using generative AI effectively.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey explain how Attention Mechanism, di engine wey dey power today&apos;s generative AI, dey work.  E say Attention Mechanism na wetin make Transformer so special, because e no need to combine many mechanisms to understand language like humans.  E dey help AI focus on important words for a sentence or text, even long ones, by ignoring irrelevant words.  Di article then introduces &quot;virtual intelligence,&quot; wey be like say AI fit separate its knowledge into different parts for different tasks, like a virtual machine.  E suggest say Attention Mechanism na like a small version of virtual intelligence (&quot;micro virtual intelligence&quot;), wey dey focus on relevant words. Finally, e proposes &quot;Explicit Attention Mechanism,&quot; wey be clear instructions on which knowledge to use for each task, wey generative AI fit update base on results. In short, dis article dey link Attention Mechanism to future AI development by suggesting say e key to more advanced intelligence and better knowledge management.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey yarn about how AI fit see and understand space for more than three dimensions, unlike humans wey limited to three. E explain say humans see 3D space based on 2D images, and suggest say we fit learn to see 4D space by using computer simulations.  E talk say AI fit do dis easily, and use dis 4D (or even more) vision to analyze complex data patterns wey humans go struggle with.  Dis ability to understand data for its original dimensions go speed up scientific discoveries and lead to paradigm shifts wey humans may not fully grasp but still benefit from.  Basically, AI go dey see things wey pass our understanding, leading to advancements wey go change our world.</description>

      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>Dis article dey tok about how generative AI don dey advance pass just being a tool, and e dey go towards systematization. E dey introduce &quot;Symphonic Intelligence&quot;, one new level of intelligence. E explain say now, dem dey use generative AI mainly for iteration work (trial and error), but dis dey limited by human capacity. To solve dis, dem need to convert iteration work to flow work, wey involve systematizing tasks and using generative AI for specific parts. Dis go make generative AI more efficient and accurate. E go also allow for knowledge sharing and gradual automation. Di article then introduce &quot;virtual intelligence&quot;, wey be di ability of generative AI to switch roles and knowledge during one task, like a virtual machine. Finally, &quot;intelligence orchestration&quot; na di ability to combine different roles and knowledge effectively. Symphonic Intelligence na di highest level, wey be like an orchestra, where different parts of AI dey work togeda seamlessly. Human intelligence na example of dis. Di article conclude say, if generative AI reach dis level, e go fit handle many complex tasks, and learn new ones easily, possibly leading to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about &quot;virtual intelligence&quot;, wey be like say you dey create fake intelligence on top of real intelligence, just like virtual machines.  E say conversational AI don dey show dis kind skill.  Di article then introduce &quot;intelligence orchestration&quot;, wey be say you go use just one AI, but inside am, you get many virtual intelligences wey dey work togeda to do different tasks.  Dis na better pass system orchestration, wey dey use many different AIs. Intelligence orchestration no need system development, you fit just use prompt instructions.  E say dis kind orchestration go push di AI to &quot;deliberate&quot;, wey mean to think from different perspectives, leading to more accurate and creative thinking.  Finally, e conclude say virtual intelligence and intelligence orchestration go make AI fit do more complex tins, like learning from mistakes and summarizing information, making dem closer to human substitutes.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about ‘simulation thinking’, wey be to follow how tins dey gather and interact step by step to understand results. E use di example of one grandpikin wey ask im grandpa for chop money, wey dey double everyday, to show say pipo no dey always understand how accumulation work. E apply dis thinking to explain how life fit start for Earth, suggesting say e start with small-small complex chemical substances wey dey form because of di planet’s global circulation and plenty chemical reactions. Dis small-small complex substances get self-maintenance, replication and metabolism, wey be di foundation for life. Di article also talk about di role of polymers, Earth’s shape, and one ‘cloud of dust’ wey protect Earth from ultraviolet rays.  E conclude say ‘simulation thinking’ na important skill, especially for software developers, wey go dey very important for future society.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about di difference between tools and systems, especially for generative AI. E explain say iteration work na small small progress, while flow work na step-by-step process.  Di article argue say for better productivity, we need to convert iteration work to flow work, and den make am a system, just like factories and IT systems.  E use examples to show say generative AI dey best for flow work systems, because e fit easily adapt and follow instructions, unlike humans. E talk say di main way to use generative AI for business na to change iteration work to flow work and make am a system, not just use am as a tool.  Many pipo dey mistake, thinking say generative AI no dey effective because dem dey use am wrongly.  To get better result, you need to change your mindset and focus on systematization of flow work.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about how generative AI dey change software development. E say because of generative AI, pipo fit create programs faster and easier.  E introduce di idea of &quot;Liquidware,&quot; wey be software wey users fit customize for their own needs, like changing screens and adding features.  Di article also talk about &quot;omnidirectional engineers,&quot; wey be pipo wey get broad knowledge of different software systems and fit oversee complex projects.  E argue say dis kind engineers go dey important because of di rise of Liquidware and di need for complex systems wey involve different kinds of software.  Di article give example of an e-commerce website wey fit use Liquidware to allow users to customize their experience.  Finally, e conclude say IT engineers suppose aim to become omnidirectional engineers, wey go involve engineering business activities and even society as a whole.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about how AI go change di way we dey think. As AI dey handle more brain work, humans go need to develop new thinking skills. E use software development as example, arguing say we go move from object-oriented programming to process-oriented programming, where each process dey treated as an independent unit. Dis shift reflect a larger societal change from overall optimization to individual optimization, wey di author call &quot;individual optimization society&quot;. To make dis individual optimization work, pipo go need to develop &quot;subjective philosophy&quot;, wey be ethical way of thinking wey value individual judgment and responsibility.  E conclude say, even with AI, humans still need to think critically and make individual judgments, making &quot;de fate of thinking&quot; inevitable.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey tok about &quot;business process-oriented software&quot;, wey be like a new way to design software.  E dey suggest say make dem design software based on how organizations dey work, by puttin&apos; all di information wey relate to one business process (manuals, input fields, contact info) inside one single file. Dis file go be di software itself, wey humans or AI fit run. AI fit help by automatically doin&apos; parts of di process or by guidin&apos; humans through di steps.  Di main advantage na say e go make am easier to change and improve business processes because you no need to change any program; just di file.  Dis go lead to a fast learnin&apos; organization wey dey more efficient.</description>

      <description>Dis article dey talk about framework design as one important intellectual activity for academia, wey dey different from di normal fact-finding wey science dey do. E dey argue say framework design, like geocentric and heliocentric theories, or Newtonian mechanics versus relativity, na inventions based on usefulness, no be discoveries of facts.  E explain say pipo wey dey good for framework design need special skill sets wey dey different from di skills for normal academic research, wey dey focus more on observation.  Software engineers, because of dia work, fit get dis special skill set wey dem need for framework design, even though e still need deep understanding of abstract concepts.</description>
