        <p class="lead">Recently, the term systems thinking has come up a lot, but as a systems engineer, I try to think of various things, not just IT systems, as systems. </p>
         <p class="lead">Although it does not necessarily include a systems perspective, it features articles that I have written from my own perspective on how to think about things. </p>

        <h2 class="display-7">About thinking</h2>
        <p class="lead">Thinking is like a hobby of mine. Thinking about various things from my own perspective has been useful both at work and in life. </p>
         <p class="lead">The following article is written from my own perspective about thinking. </p>

        <h2 class="display-7">About the way of life</h2>
        <p class="lead">It seems that living is perceived as something difficult. You may feel this way especially if someone often shows you an example of how to live or insists on something like the right path. </p>
         <p class="lead">I have always believed that it is important to understand one's own personality and values, and aim for a state that fits them. I have always believed that once a direction is determined, it is important to consider the minimum amount of effort and ingenuity needed to reach that state and continue to maintain it. </p>
         <p class="lead">It may be difficult for many people to have such a realistic and rational way of thinking, but I have summarized my thoughts in the article below in the hope that it will be helpful. I am. </p>

        <h2 class="display-7">About values</h2>
        <p class="lead">Everyone has different values, and the things we choose and the choices we make in life change according to our values. </p>
         <p class="lead">I believe that we can change and develop our own values. I myself have reviewed and updated my values to make my life easier. </p>

        <h2 class="display-7">Problem solving</h2>
        <p class="lead">Understanding the problem correctly is more important than solving the problem. Ever since we were children, we have become so accustomed to being given problems that have been sorted out by someone else that we are surprisingly bad at figuring out problems ourselves and grasping them properly. </p>
         <p class="lead">This article is not about how to solve a problem that has already been formulated, but rather about the way of thinking and approach to understanding the problem firmly. </p>
         <p class="lead">This is also a technique equivalent to requirements analysis and outline design in system development. </p>

        <p class="lead">With the advent of generative AI and conversational AI, we are thinking more about language. I also write short stories myself, so I have an interest in stories. </p>
