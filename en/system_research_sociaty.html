        <h2 class="display-7">General</h2>
        <p class="lead">It is becoming clear that the remarkable development of artificial intelligence technology will have a major impact on society. </p>
        <p class="lead">We will be facing an unprecedented change in which we will incorporate intelligence other than our own into society, and if technological progress continues at this rate, we will soon have intellectual abilities greater than our own. The emergence of artificial intelligence will also become a reality. </p>
        <p class="lead">With an unknown situation that no one can foresee approaching, it is not enough for artificial intelligence researchers and engineers to consider the impact and safety alone. </p>
        <p class="lead">The following appeal was written to emphasize that it is an urgent issue for as many people as possible to understand the current situation and think about the future. </p>

        <p class="lead">Communities and organizations are collections of individuals. And they form society. </p>
        <p class="lead">On the other hand, individuals also change and use their own personalities depending on the community. Analyzed in this way, individuals are a collection of personalities, and communities and organizations are also collections of personalities. </p>
        <p class="lead">In the following articles, we will consider the nature of communities based on the idea that both individuals and communities are collections of personalities. </p>

        <p class="lead">It is said that division and conflict are progressing in modern times, and this is also felt from news reports, online articles, and information on SNS. </p>
        <p class="lead">In order to improve this situation, a spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding are important. On the other hand, it is also important to understand the nature of this society. </p>
        <p class="lead">In the following articles, we will analyze the nature of society and see that there are many situations where division and conflict are not necessarily necessary. We will also explain why modern social issues are becoming more difficult and explain why it is important to clarify our values. </p>

        <h2 class="display-7">Willism & refactorism</h2>
        <p class="lead">In order to solve today's difficult problems, we believe that it is important for various people to cooperate across disciplines, and that both academic and practical abilities are important. </p>
        <p class="lead">In order for various people with different fields and positions to cooperate, it is important to build a successful cooperative system. In addition, you will need a core way of thinking. </p>
        <p class="lead">I propose the idea of Willism from the viewpoint that it is important to respect the values and intentions of each individual, rather than searching for absolute shared values. I am. </p>
        <p class="lead">Also, when approaching social problems in a mature modern society, rather than destroying the functions and mechanisms that have already been accumulated in society, we should make use of them and transform problematic structures. We advocate refactorism from the standpoint that it is important to move forward. </p>
